# Cancer-Pinpoint
My Project is a part of a bigger project to use ultrasound to track the movement of cancer and then guide the radiation therapy to follow and target at the cancer. 

## Introduction
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a targeted treatment currently widely used in curing cancer. It could target at the cancer area and thus bringing less harm to surrounding normal areas. However, with the interference of involuntary motion, including respiration, cardiac activity, we have to target at the whole areas that cancer may move around, which also harms the normal tissues during treatments. Our goal is to use ultrasound to track the movement of cancer and then guide the radiation therapy to follow and target at the cancer. 

My project is a part of this project. It could help users to manually annotate the coordinates of cancers and then examine the correctness of the data from ultrasound.

## Features
All the functions can be realized by GUI.

##### 1.Annotate coordinates

##### 2.Plot the coordinates

##### 3.Examine the correctness of the data from ultrasound by comparing them with the manually annotated data.
